# Introduce

Highly motivated and results-oriented Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience in C/C++/C# programming and STL, specializing in game engine architecture and performance optimization.

### Who I Am
I was drawn to coding because of the process of turning imagination into reality using data and coding technology. This ability to create something from nothing has always fascinated me, and it’s this passion that led me to pursue a career in development. As I’ve gained experience, I’ve developed a particular interest in optimizing application performance and working with low-level technologies.

I am driven by the desire to challenge myself, expand my horizons, and dream bigger. With a vision to work on innovative projects, I aspire to grow and eventually explore opportunities beyond borders, aiming to contribute to the global tech landscape.

### My Strength
To achieve my goals and dreams, I put in great effort at Chung-Ang University, where I majored in Psychology and double majored in Statistics-based AI. This multidisciplinary program helped me develop strong analytical and technical skills through courses in statistics and computer science. 

Later, to build expertise in another field, I pursued a degree in Information and Communications Engineering, further enhancing my knowledge in computer networks.

In addition, I have developed my programming skills through various external activities such as game development academies, web programming courses, and the Purdue University IoT English program.

Although I faced challenges studying in an unfamiliar field, I persevered with determination and passion, viewing it as a crucial step toward achieving my dreams, and overcame it through dedication and hard work.

### Goal
My primary interests lie in software development with C/C++/C#, and I am passionate about system optimization and solving complex technical challenges. 

In the future, I aim to leverage my experience to create software based on C/C++/C#, contributing to areas such as graphic APIs, Window OS technologies, network programming, and my strengths in game engine development. 

Although my experience includes game engine development, I am eager to work in the broader C/C++/C# software field, not limited to the gaming industry.
