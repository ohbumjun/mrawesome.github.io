![BumJunOh_Introduction](/Images/home/BumJunOh_Intro_Small.jpg)

I am a C/C++/C# software developer currently working as a Game Engine Programmer at Com2us. My focus is on creating high-performance, secure software, with a strong interest in advancing my expertise in graphics APIs and network programming.

I hold a bachelor's degree from Chung-Ang University, where I majored in Psychology and double majored in Statistics-based AI. This multidisciplinary program encompassed a range of courses in statistics and computer science, equipping me with analytical and technical skills. To further expand my knowledge, I pursued a degree in Information and Communications Engineering, deepening my understanding of computer networks.

My primary interests lie in software development with C/C++/C#, and I am passionate about optimizing systems and tackling complex technical challenges.

# Career

## *Com2us*
* Seoul, Republic of Korea
Game Engine Programmer at Com2us Proprietary Game Engine Team
January 2023 - Present

As a Game Engine Programmer, I design and implement core engine systems, enhancing performance and functionality across various components. I work on features such as real-time build systems, image compression, multithreading, memory management, and asset systems, all aimed at optimizing gameplay and developer workflows. I also develop custom systems for C++/C# interoperability, runtime reflection, and advanced object management, ensuring a seamless experience across complex game projects.

# Skills
## Programming Languages    
![C++Logo](../Images/home/C++Logo.png "C++"){: width="60"}  
* C++ is my primary programming language. I am a professional game programmer and use it every day.
* I am knowledgeable of modern C++; STL, move semantics, template, and many other recent features. I can apply advanced features to design and construct games and other applications with high performance.
* C++ is compiled into native code and supports an object-oriented programming paradigm, which makes it the most suitable language for developing real-time applications. I have a deep understanding of the philosophy of C++.

<br />
![CSharpLogo](../Images/home/CSharpLogo.png "C#"){: width="60"}  

* I use C# frequently for a personal game project along with Unity. I have been using C# for a long time; thus I have a deep understanding of its features.
* C# features well-designed and concise functionality and keywords. I know how to utilize them to boost the software development process fully.  
* As to a few weaknesses of C#, like performance issues due to garbage collection, I am experienced with optimizing those codes.

## Game Engine
![UnityLogo](../Images/home/UnityLogo.png "Unity"){: width="160"}
* I have been developing my own game with Unity for over three years. 
* Since the project is aimed at commercial success, I have encountered numerous challenges while developing each disparate part. With deep considerations about how to formulate Unity components, I was able to make a breakthrough.
* Not only do I use functionality offered by Unity, but in order to enrich my game project, I have also been highly customizing terrain, animation system, shader, and the multiplayer API(Mirror).

## Graphics API
![VulkanLogo](../Images/home/VulkanLogo.png "Vulkan"){: width="150"}
* Vulkan is my way of presenting graphical ideas along with GPU programming.
* I am capable of managing various Vulkan resources to establish complicated rendering pipelines, eventually building up complicated applications upon them.
* Compute shader along with Vulkan is my favorite way of boosting parallel computation. Take a look at my [fluid simulation with Vulkan compute shader](https://youtu.be/SPOenCZRLrk)!
* I am engaging Vulkan to develop a high-performance in-house fluid simulation tool powered by Vulkan, GLSL, and ImGUI.
