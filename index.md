I am a C/C++ software developer at Com2us with a keen interest in creating high-performance, secure software, and I'm seeking to expand my knowledge of both graphics APIs and network programming. I am currently working as Game Engine Programmer. I got my bachelor's degree at Chung-Ang University, where I majored in psychology and double majored in "Statistics based AI" which includes several classes including both statistics & computer science. I pursued a degree in Information and Communications Engineering to broaden my knowledge and skills in computer network. My main interests are C/C++ SW Development.
