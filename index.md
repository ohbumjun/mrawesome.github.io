"I am a **Graphics Engineer** at Arm looking for a new horizon of graphics API and GPU. Prior to that, I was a Game Engine Programmer at Com2us Korea. I got my bachelor's degree at Chung-Ang University, where I majored in psychology and double majored in "Statistics based AI" which includes several classes including both statistics & computer science. My main interests are C/C++ SW Development. I am also keen on other fields of computer science, including computer systems, algorithm, and video game."
