As a Proprietary Game Engine Programmer at Com2us Korea, I was responsible for developing "Dungeon Delivery," a game successfully launched on both Android and iOS platforms. 
This involved porting an existing Unity C# project to our company's proprietary C++ game engine : [Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZVnSdxScOw&list=PLkaVDtEaS2nYfen53nEdOUmKztDxLHWF3)

@ **C# to C++ Conversion Tool Using Roslyn API**: Developed a Roslyn-based C# to C++ conversion tool specifically designed to streamline the porting of Unity C# projects to custom game engines. 
This tool was instrumental in accelerating the development of "Dungeon Delivery" by automatically translating key gameplay logic, systems, and scripts. 
By automating the porting process, we were able to reduce development time by at least two weeks.

# Conclusion

Through my involvement in the development of 'Dungeon Delivery,' 
I had the opportunity to gain firsthand experience in game content creation and network client logic. 
This hands-on experience allowed me to identify specific features and functionalities that are essential for a robust game engine, 
informing my understanding of the design and implementation of game engine systems
