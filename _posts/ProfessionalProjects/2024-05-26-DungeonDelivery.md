As a Proprietary Game Engine Programmer at Com2us Korea, I was responsible for developing "Dungeon Delivery," a game successfully launched on both Android and iOS platforms. 
This involved porting an existing Unity C# project to our company's proprietary C++ game engine : [Project](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.com2us.ddelivery.normal.freefull.google.global.android.common&hl=ko)
