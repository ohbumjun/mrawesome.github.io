"I am a **Graphics Engineer** at Arm looking for a new horizon of graphics API and GPU. Prior to that, I was a Gameplay & Engine Programmer at Nexon Korea. I also interned at NCSoft in the Vision AI Lab. I got my bachelor's degree at Seoul National University, where I double-majored in geography and computer science. My main interests are GPU and computer graphics. I am also keen on other fields of computer science, including computer systems, algorithm, and video game."
